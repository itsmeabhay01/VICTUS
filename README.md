## Overview
The project aims to analyze vehicle movements within a college campus, providing valuable insights into parking occupancy, and security. By utilizing advanced object detection and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, this system can detect vehicles, recognize license plates, and differentiate between authorized and unauthorized vehicles.

## Pre-requisites
- YOLOv8 Framework: For vehicle detection, YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework
- OCR Tools: Optical Character Recognition tools used is EasyOCR for license plate recognition
- Development Environment: Google Colab or a similar environment for model training and experimentation
- Programming Languages: Python for developing and integrating the detection and recognition algorithms
- Vehicle Images: A diverse and comprehensive dataset of vehicle images captured from various angles and lighting conditions

## Category
Machine Learning, Deep Learning

## Semester
6th
